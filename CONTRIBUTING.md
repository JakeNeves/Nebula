## Contributing to the project

If you want to contribute spritework, music, etc. You can go right ahead,
as long as I give it the approval to be used in the game! This is based on
the quality and probably the theme that the game goes for...

Upon contributing your additions, iterations and such, it may take a while
or so for your name to show up in the credits.
