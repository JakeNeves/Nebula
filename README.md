No functional build of the game is available right now, once there is, there should
be a build ready, other than the old Haxe-Flixel prototype builds.

Feel free to contribute some music, art, code, etc., the game is being developed
with GameMaker!

# Plot

You play as Emperor Jake I of Gallahard, as you wake up from a 2 year comba, only to find out that your homeland, the Gallahard Empire has laid to ruin and collaped by the tyrannical demon overlord, Sylux! Journey through the empire as Emperor Jake I tries to fight back against the demon overlord and his forces, with a hint of unexpected twists! Do you have the wits to take on the tyrant and save Gallahard?

# Endings

There are three endings you can get, depending on which path you take!

#### Neutral Ending

The default ending that you get, no matter what you do, Sylux kills the Emperor of Gallahard and now it's just you, the player and Sylux to decide your fate, will you let the tyrant delete your save file, or will you refrain from handing your precious save file over to him to delete?

#### Failed Emperor

The second ending that you can get, Sylux doesn't kill the Emperor of Gallahard, but rather slowly gets bored of fighting you to the point where he stops and gets a minor reality check, then goes on to brag about needing to reset the timeline...

#### True Revelation

The third and true ending, Emperor Jake I battles against Sylux and deals a final blow to the tyrant, as well as recrute a massive and ludicrous army to help push back the demonic forces with him, and save Gallahard!

# Gameplay

There are three different game modes, each with some twists part way through!

#### RPG Mode

The way the game is intended to be played, of course with some of that good old series of quests and side quests and a decent amount of areas to explore!

#### Platformer Mode

Part way through the game, you'll stumble across across some platforming, but be careful, a lot of the platforming can be quite a challenge, maybe a bit learny in some cases, with the ability to double jump, wall jump and dash, those abilities are gated behind bosses, except for wall jumping, you can get anywhere quite easily, even in some of the toughest situations!

#### Shmup Mode

Have you ever played games like Gradius, 1942 or even UN Squadron, then this game mode might have a similar feeling to those game, but with some crazy twists and such, it's probably going to be a wild ride with this game mode!

# Secrets

Who knows what secrets you can find, just don't try to find specific secrets, otherwise the demon overlord will get jealous and tamper your save file, he could throw you back to the main menu or reload where you last save!

Otherwise there are some fun little secrets, and some of them can be quite creepy, depending on what you find throughout your journey...
