Install Your Mods Here, If you are making ANY changes to
the code rather than installing simple reskins or visuals,
you MUST have the source code downloaded from Github! If you've
downloaded the game or the source code from sketchy or any other
websites, you could be potentially in trouble as demons could
invade your computer and inflict your files with deadly powers
or inject your entire pc with a deadly neurotoxin. (that's a joke,
how would you even inject your computer with deadly neurotoxins anyway...)

Link to the repository -> https://github.com/JakeNeves/Nebula (Make sure you download the latest version!)

in the README.md file, there is a step by step guide to setting up nebula for code modification!
